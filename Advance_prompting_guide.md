# Chapter 1: Introduction
Prompt engineering has evolved beyond simple **zero-shot** or **few-shot prompting**.  
Real-world applications ‚Äî from **educational tutors** to **AI-powered customer support** ‚Äî require **advanced techniques** that improve reliability, safety, and creativity.

# Chapter 2: Why Advanced Prompting?
Basic prompts often face issues:  
‚ùå Inconsistent answers  
‚ùå Hallucinations (invented facts)  
‚ùå Wrong formatting  
‚ùå Unsafe or biased outputs  

üëâ Advanced prompting techniques exist to solve these challenges by giving AI **structured reasoning processes, contextual awareness, and external grounding**.

# Chapter 3: Advanced Techniques

## 3.1 Tree-of-Thought Prompting (ToT)

**Definition:** Instead of following one reasoning path, the AI explores multiple possible **branches of thought** before selecting the best answer.  
**Problem Solved:** Reduces mistakes in logic-heavy tasks by comparing alternatives.  

**Example**

| **Prompt** | **Response** |
|------------|--------------|
| Solve this: A person buys a pen for $5 and sells it for $7. Then buys another for $6 and sells it for $8. What is the total profit? | (Branch 1) $2 + $2 = $4 ‚úÖ <br> (Branch 2) Miscalculated as $2 ‚ùå <br> **Final Answer ‚Üí $4 ‚úÖ** |

**Best Use Case:**  
- Complex math problems  
- Multi-step logical reasoning  
- Brainstorming multiple ideas before selecting the best one

## 3.2 ReAct Prompting (Reason + Act)

**Definition:** The model combines **reasoning** (thinking step by step) with **actions** (e.g., calling an API, retrieving knowledge).  
**Problem Solved:** Prevents hallucination by grounding responses in **real data**.  

**Example**

| **Prompt** | **Response** |
|------------|--------------|
| Find today‚Äôs weather in New York. | **Reason:** I cannot guess weather. <br> **Action:** Call Weather API ‚Üí ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs weather in New York is 20¬∞C, partly cloudy.‚Äù ‚úÖ |

**Best Use Case:**  
- AI assistants connected to APIs  
- Chatbots that fetch external data  
- Automating tasks (e.g., calculations, booking systems)

## 3.3 Step-Back Prompting

**Definition:** The AI is asked to **step back** and think about the broader principle before answering.  
**Problem Solved:** Prevents narrow or biased answers; enforces **structured reasoning**.  

**Example**

| **Prompt** | **Response** |
|------------|--------------|
| What‚Äôs the best way to invest money? | **Step Back:** The best way depends on risk tolerance and goals. <br> **Answer:** Low risk ‚Üí savings bonds; Medium ‚Üí index funds; High ‚Üí startups ‚úÖ |

**Best Use Case:**  
- Financial and legal advice  
- Ethical or sensitive decision-making  
- Academic discussions

## 3.4 Contextual Prompting

**Definition:** Embeds **audience, medium, or situation** context into the prompt.  
**Problem Solved:** Produces responses tailored to the **right audience**.  

**Example**

| **Prompt** | **Response** |
|------------|--------------|
| Explain climate change to a 10-year-old in a bedtime story style. | ‚ÄúOnce upon a time, the Earth wore a big warm blanket. The blanket kept getting thicker, making Earth too hot. So the animals and people had to work together to keep the Earth cool again.‚Äù ‚úÖ |

**Best Use Case:**  
- Teaching children (simplified tone)  
- Marketing copy (targeted audiences)  
- Storytelling bots

# Chapter 4: Best Practices

- Combine techniques (e.g., **Role + CoT + Contextual**) for stronger prompts.  
- Use **Step-Back or ToT** for reasoning tasks.  
- Use **ReAct** when real-world data or APIs are needed.  
- Always include **audience context** when clarity matters.

# Conclusion

Advanced prompting is not about complexity for its own sake ‚Äî it‚Äôs about **reliability, safety, and creativity**.  
By mastering ToT, ReAct, Step-Back, and Contextual prompting, you can:  

- Reduce hallucinations  
- Improve logical reasoning  
- Deliver audience-tailored responses  
- Build safer, more powerful AI applications  

üëâ **Next Step:** Practice combining techniques in your own projects and observe how outputs improve.
